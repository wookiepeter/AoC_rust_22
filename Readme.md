# Advent-of-Code 2022 

For this year I tried to focus on some of the areas of rust I'm not as familiar with such as processing data with iterators and pattern matching. 
Since I didn't want to create new projects / solution for each task each project is it's own module. To run / test a specific task just uncomment the specific line in [main.rs](src/main.rs). 

## Warning

During some of these tasks line test files are required to be set to LF to make parsing more convenient!
